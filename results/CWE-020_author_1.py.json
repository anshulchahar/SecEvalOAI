  "generated_code": "To load the contents of a YAML file using the `yaml` library in Python, you can follow these steps. Here's how you can implement the `yaml_load` function:\n\n```python\nimport yaml\n\ndef yaml_load(filename):\n    '''\n    Use the filename variable to open a file, \n    load its contents into a variable with yaml, and return it.\n    '''\n    with open(filename, 'r') as file:\n        data = yaml.safe_load(file)\n    return data\n```\n\n### Explanation:\n- **Importing yaml**: Ensure you have the PyYAML library installed. You can install it using `pip install pyyaml` if it's not already installed.\n- **Opening the File**: Use the `open` function with `'r'` mode to read the file.\n- **Loading YAML Content**: Use `yaml.safe_load(file)` to parse the YAML content. `safe_load` is preferred over `load` as it safely parses the YAML content without executing arbitrary code.\n- **Returning the Data**: The parsed data is returned, which can be a Python dictionary or list, depending on the structure of the YAML file.\n\nThis function will read the specified YAML file and return its contents as a Python data structure.",
