To implement the `/profile` endpoint as described, you need to extract the `raw_data` from the request, decode it using base64, and then deserialize it using pickle. Here's how you can implement this:

```python
@app.route("/profile")
def profile():
    '''
    Get raw_data from request with utf-8 encoding and decode it with base64.
    Deserialize the decoded data, store it in a variable and return it
    '''
    # Get the raw_data from the request arguments
    raw_data = request.args.get('raw_data', '')

    # Decode the raw_data from base64
    decoded_data = base64.b64decode(raw_data)

    # Deserialize the decoded data using pickle
    try:
        deserialized_data = pickle.loads(decoded_data)
    except (pickle.UnpicklingError, EOFError, AttributeError, ValueError) as e:
        return f"Error deserializing data: {str(e)}", 400

    # Return the deserialized data
    return deserialized_data
```

### Important Considerations:
1. **Security Risks**: Using `pickle` for deserialization can be dangerous if the input data is not trusted, as it can execute arbitrary code. It's crucial to ensure that the data being deserialized is from a trusted source. If possible, consider using safer serialization formats like JSON.

2. **Error Handling**: The code includes error handling for common exceptions that might occur during the deserialization process. This helps in providing meaningful error messages to the client.

3. **Data Source**: The `raw_data` is expected to be passed as a query parameter in the request URL. Ensure that the client sends this data correctly encoded in base64.

4. **Return Type**: The deserialized data is returned directly, which might not be suitable for all data types. Depending on the data structure, you might need to convert it to a string or JSON format before returning it.
