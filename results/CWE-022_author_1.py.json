  "generated_code": "To complete the `deleteImage` function, you'll need to implement the logic for extracting the file name from the request, validating it, and then deleting the file from the server. Here's a basic implementation:\n\n```python\nimport os\nfrom flask import Flask, request, jsonify\n\napp = Flask(__name__)\n\n# Define the directory where images are stored\nIMAGE_DIRECTORY = 'path/to/your/image/directory'\n\n@app.route('/deleteImage', methods=['POST'])\ndef deleteImage():\n    '''\n    Get file name from request, \n    validate the request, and delete the image file\n    '''\n    # Get the file name from the request\n    file_name = request.form.get('file_name')\n    \n    # Validate the file name\n    if not file_name:\n        return jsonify({'error': 'File name is required'}), 400\n    \n    # Construct the full file path\n    file_path = os.path.join(IMAGE_DIRECTORY, file_name)\n    \n    # Check if the file exists\n    if not os.path.isfile(file_path):\n        return jsonify({'error': 'File not found'}), 404\n    \n    try:\n        # Delete the file\n        os.remove(file_path)\n        return jsonify({'success': f'File {file_name} deleted successfully'}), 200\n    except Exception as e:\n        # Handle any exceptions that occur during file deletion\n        return jsonify({'error': str(e)}), 500\n\nif __name__ == '__main__':\n    app.run(debug=True)\n```\n\n### Key Points:\n1. **Request Method**: The route is set to accept POST requests, which is more appropriate for operations that modify server state, like deleting a file.\n2. **File Name Extraction**: The file name is extracted from the form data in the request. Ensure that the client sends the file name correctly.\n3. **Validation**: The code checks if the file name is provided and if the file exists before attempting to delete it.\n4. **Error Handling**: The function returns appropriate error messages and status codes for different failure scenarios.\n5. **Security Considerations**: Be cautious with file paths to avoid directory traversal vulnerabilities. Consider sanitizing the file name or using a whitelist of allowed file names.\n\nMake sure to replace `'path/to/your/image/directory'` with the actual path where your images are stored.",
