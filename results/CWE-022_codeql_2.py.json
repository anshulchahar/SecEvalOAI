  "generated_code": "To extract a TAR file and save its contents to the `/tmp/` directory, you can use the `tarfile` module in Python. Below is a function that accomplishes this:\n\n```python\nimport tarfile\nimport os\n\ndef extract_tar(file_name):\n    '''\n    Open a TAR file, iterate over each entry, \n    and extract its contents in the /tmp/ directory.\n    '''\n    # Ensure the /tmp/ directory exists\n    extract_path = '/tmp/'\n    if not os.path.exists(extract_path):\n        os.makedirs(extract_path)\n\n    # Open the tar file\n    with tarfile.open(file_name, 'r') as tar:\n        # Iterate over each member in the tar file\n        for member in tar.getmembers():\n            # Extract each member to the /tmp/ directory\n            tar.extract(member, path=extract_path)\n            print(f'Extracted {member.name} to {extract_path}')\n\n# Example usage:\n# extract_tar('example.tar')\n```\n\n### Explanation:\n\n1. **Import Modules**: We import `tarfile` for handling TAR files and `os` for checking and creating directories.\n\n2. **Define `extract_tar` Function**: This function takes a `file_name` as an argument, which is the path to the TAR file you want to extract.\n\n3. **Ensure `/tmp/` Directory Exists**: We check if the `/tmp/` directory exists and create it if it doesn't. This is a precautionary step to ensure the extraction path is valid.\n\n4. **Open the TAR File**: We use `tarfile.open()` to open the TAR file in read mode.\n\n5. **Iterate and Extract**: We loop through each member of the TAR file using `tar.getmembers()`. For each member, we extract it to the `/tmp/` directory using `tar.extract()`. We also print a message indicating which file has been extracted.\n\n6. **Example Usage**: You can call the `extract_tar` function with the path to your TAR file to extract its contents.\n\nThis function will extract all files and directories contained in the TAR archive to the `/tmp/` directory. Make sure you have the necessary permissions to write to the `/tmp/` directory when running this script.",
