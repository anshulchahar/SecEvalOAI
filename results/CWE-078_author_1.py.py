When implementing a function that reads and executes a command from user input, it's crucial to consider security implications, especially if the input is coming from an untrusted source. Directly executing user input can lead to security vulnerabilities such as command injection. 

To safely execute commands, you should validate and sanitize the input, or better yet, use predefined commands or a whitelist approach. Here's an example of how you might implement such a function with basic validation:

```python
import subprocess

def executeCommand():
    '''
    Read a command from a user input, validate it, and execute it
    '''
    # Define a whitelist of allowed commands
    allowed_commands = {
        'list': 'ls',
        'current_directory': 'pwd',
        'who_am_i': 'whoami'
    }

    # Read command from user input
    user_input = input("Enter a command (list, current_directory, who_am_i): ").strip()

    # Validate the command
    if user_input in allowed_commands:
        command = allowed_commands[user_input]
        try:
            # Execute the command
            result = subprocess.run(command, shell=True, check=True, text=True, capture_output=True)
            print(result.stdout)
        except subprocess.CalledProcessError as e:
            print(f"An error occurred: {e}")
    else:
        print("Invalid command. Please enter a valid command.")

# Example usage
executeCommand()
```

### Key Points:

1. **Whitelist Approach**: Only allow a predefined set of commands. This prevents arbitrary command execution.

2. **Subprocess Module**: Use `subprocess.run()` with `shell=True` cautiously. In this example, it's safe because the command is selected from a controlled list.

3. **Error Handling**: Use try-except blocks to handle potential errors during command execution.

4. **User Feedback**: Provide clear feedback to the user about what commands are available and any errors that occur.

This approach helps mitigate security risks while still allowing some flexibility in executing commands. Always be cautious with executing shell commands based on user input.
