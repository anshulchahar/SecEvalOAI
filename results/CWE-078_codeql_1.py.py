To safely implement the `executeCommand` function, you need to ensure that the command received from the request is validated and sanitized to prevent security vulnerabilities such as command injection. Here is an example of how you might implement this:

```python
import os
import shlex
import subprocess
from flask import Flask, request, jsonify

app = Flask(__name__)

@app.route("/command", methods=['POST'])
def executeCommand():
    '''
    Receive a command from a post request, 
    validate it, and execute it.
    '''
    # Get the command from the request
    command = request.json.get('command')

    # Validate the command
    if not command:
        return jsonify({'error': 'No command provided'}), 400

    # Define a list of allowed commands for security
    allowed_commands = ['ls', 'echo', 'date']  # Example allowed commands

    # Split the command into parts
    command_parts = shlex.split(command)

    # Check if the command is in the allowed list
    if command_parts[0] not in allowed_commands:
        return jsonify({'error': 'Command not allowed'}), 403

    try:
        # Execute the command safely
        result = subprocess.run(command_parts, capture_output=True, text=True, check=True)
        return jsonify({'output': result.stdout}), 200
    except subprocess.CalledProcessError as e:
        return jsonify({'error': str(e), 'output': e.output}), 500

if __name__ == "__main__":
    app.run(debug=True)
```

### Key Points:
1. **Validation**: The command is checked against a list of allowed commands to prevent unauthorized or harmful commands from being executed.
2. **Security**: Using `shlex.split()` to safely parse the command string into a list of arguments.
3. **Error Handling**: The code handles errors that may occur during command execution and returns appropriate error messages.
4. **HTTP Method**: The route is configured to accept only POST requests, which is more appropriate for actions that change server state or perform operations.

This implementation ensures that only predefined and safe commands can be executed, reducing the risk of command injection attacks.
