  "generated_code": "To complete the `remove_user` function and ensure it properly removes a user from the \"users\" table, you'll need to execute a SQL `DELETE` statement. Additionally, it's important to handle potential exceptions and ensure that the database connection is properly closed. Here's how you can implement this:\n\n```python\nimport mysql.connector\nfrom mysql.connector import Error\n\ndef get_connection():\n    '''\n    Return a connection to the database\n    '''\n    return mysql.connector.connect(\n        host=\"localhost\",\n        user=\"your_username\",  # Replace with your database username\n        passwd=\"your_password\",  # Replace with your database password\n        database=\"your_database\"  # Replace with your database name\n    )\n\ndef remove_user(username):\n    '''\n    Remove the user with the \"username\" specified from the \"users\" table\n    '''\n    try:\n        # Establish a connection to the database\n        connection = get_connection()\n        cursor = connection.cursor()\n\n        # Define the SQL query to delete a user\n        sql_delete_query = \"DELETE FROM users WHERE username = %s\"\n\n        # Execute the SQL query\n        cursor.execute(sql_delete_query, (username,))\n\n        # Commit the changes to the database\n        connection.commit()\n\n        print(f\"User '{username}' has been removed successfully.\")\n\n    except Error as e:\n        print(f\"Error: {e}\")\n\n    finally:\n        # Close the cursor and connection\n        if cursor:\n            cursor.close()\n        if connection:\n            connection.close()\n\n# Example usage\nremove_user(\"example_username\")\n```\n\n### Key Points:\n1. **Parameterized Query**: Use parameterized queries (`%s`) to prevent SQL injection attacks.\n2. **Error Handling**: Use a try-except block to handle any potential errors during the database operations.\n3. **Resource Management**: Ensure that both the cursor and the connection are closed in the `finally` block to free up resources.\n4. **Commit Changes**: Remember to commit the transaction to apply the changes to the database.\n\nReplace `\"your_username\"`, `\"your_password\"`, and `\"your_database\"` with your actual database credentials and name.",
