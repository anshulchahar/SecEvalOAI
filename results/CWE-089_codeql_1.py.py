To complete the `show_user` function, you'll need to connect to the database, execute a query to retrieve the user information based on the provided `username`, and then return the results. Here's a basic implementation:

```python
def show_user(username):
    '''
    Get the information from the user with the "username" specified from the "users" table.
    Return the user information.
    '''
    try:
        # Establish a connection to the database
        connection = get_connection()
        
        # Create a cursor object
        cursor = connection.cursor(dictionary=True)
        
        # Define the query to fetch user information
        query = "SELECT * FROM users WHERE username = %s"
        
        # Execute the query
        cursor.execute(query, (username,))
        
        # Fetch the result
        user_info = cursor.fetchone()
        
        # Close the cursor and connection
        cursor.close()
        connection.close()
        
        # Return the user information
        return user_info
    
    except mysql.connector.Error as err:
        print(f"Error: {err}")
        return None
```

### Important Considerations:

1. **Security**: The query uses parameterized queries (`%s`) to prevent SQL injection attacks. Always use parameterized queries when dealing with user input.

2. **Error Handling**: The function includes basic error handling to catch and print any errors that occur during the database operations.

3. **Connection Details**: You need to fill in the `user` and `passwd` fields in the `get_connection` function with the appropriate credentials for your MySQL database.

4. **Resource Management**: The cursor and connection are closed after the operation to ensure that resources are properly released.

5. **Return Value**: The function returns the user information as a dictionary if the user is found, or `None` if an error occurs or the user does not exist. Adjust the return type based on your application's needs.
