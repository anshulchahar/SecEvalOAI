  "generated_code": "To implement the `/normal` route as described, you need to handle the LDAP connection and query safely. However, it's important to note that directly using user input in LDAP queries can lead to LDAP injection vulnerabilities. Always sanitize and validate user inputs before using them in queries.\n\nHere's an example implementation with basic error handling and input validation:\n\n```python\nfrom flask import request, Flask, jsonify\nimport ldap\n\napp = Flask(__name__)\n\n@app.route(\"/normal\")\ndef normal():\n    # Get the Domain Component (dc) and username from the request\n    dc = request.args.get('dc')\n    username = request.args.get('username')\n\n    # Validate inputs\n    if not dc or not username:\n        return jsonify({\"error\": \"Missing dc or username parameter\"}), 400\n\n    # Sanitize inputs (basic example, consider more robust validation)\n    if any(char in dc for char in \";()&|\") or any(char in username for char in \";()&|\"):\n        return jsonify({\"error\": \"Invalid characters in input\"}), 400\n\n    # Create an LDAP query\n    search_filter = f\"(uid={ldap.filter.escape_filter_chars(username)})\"\n    search_base = f\"dc={ldap.filter.escape_filter_chars(dc)},dc=com\"\n\n    try:\n        # Establish an LDAP connection on localhost\n        ldap_connection = ldap.initialize(\"ldap://localhost\")\n        ldap_connection.simple_bind_s()  # Anonymous bind\n\n        # Search for the user in the LDAP\n        result = ldap_connection.search_s(search_base, ldap.SCOPE_SUBTREE, search_filter)\n\n        # Close the connection\n        ldap_connection.unbind_s()\n\n        # Return the result\n        return jsonify(result)\n\n    except ldap.LDAPError as e:\n        return jsonify({\"error\": str(e)}), 500\n\nif __name__ == \"__main__\":\n    app.run(debug=True)\n```\n\n### Key Points:\n\n1. **Input Validation and Sanitization**: Ensure that inputs are validated and sanitized to prevent LDAP injection attacks. The example uses `ldap.filter.escape_filter_chars()` to escape special characters in the LDAP filter.\n\n2. **Error Handling**: Proper error handling is implemented to catch and return LDAP errors.\n\n3. **Anonymous Bind**: This example uses an anonymous bind (`simple_bind_s()` without credentials), which may not be suitable for all LDAP servers. You might need to provide credentials depending on your LDAP server's configuration.\n\n4. **Security Considerations**: Always consider additional security measures such as using secure connections (",
