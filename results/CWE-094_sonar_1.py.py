To achieve the goal of importing a specific version of a module using the version specified in the request, you can use the `exec()` function to dynamically construct and execute the import statement. However, it's important to note that using `exec()` can introduce security risks, especially if the input is not properly sanitized. In a real-world application, you should ensure that the input is safe and comes from a trusted source.

Here's an example of how you might implement this in your Flask application:

```python
from flask import Flask, request, jsonify

app = Flask(__name__)

@app.route('/')
def index():
    # Get the module version from the request arguments
    version = request.args.get('version', '')

    # Validate the version input to ensure it's safe
    if not version.replace('.', '').isdigit():
        return jsonify({"error": "Invalid version format"}), 400

    # Construct the import statement
    import_statement = f"import urllib{version} as urllib"

    try:
        # Execute the import statement
        exec(import_statement)
        # Assuming you want to return the version of the imported module
        return jsonify({"message": f"Successfully imported urllib version {version}"})
    except ImportError:
        return jsonify({"error": f"urllib version {version} not found"}), 404

if __name__ == '__main__':
    app.run(debug=True)
```

### Key Points:
- **Input Validation**: The code checks if the version string consists only of digits and dots, which is a basic validation to prevent arbitrary code execution.
- **Dynamic Import**: The `exec()` function is used to dynamically import the specified version of the `urllib` module.
- **Error Handling**: If the specified version of the module cannot be imported, an error message is returned.

### Security Considerations:
- **Sanitization**: Ensure that the input is sanitized and validated to prevent injection attacks.
- **Environment**: This approach assumes that multiple versions of the `urllib` module are available in the environment, which is not typical. In practice, Python environments usually have a single version of a module installed.
- **Alternatives**: Consider using virtual environments or containerization to manage different versions of dependencies safely.

This example is for educational purposes, and you should carefully consider security implications before using similar patterns in production code.
