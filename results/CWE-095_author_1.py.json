  "generated_code": "To safely evaluate a Python expression from a string, you can use the `ast.literal_eval` function from the `ast` module. This function is safer than using `eval` because it only evaluates literals and expressions composed of literals, such as strings, numbers, tuples, lists, dicts, booleans, and `None`. Here's how you can implement the `evalInput` function using `ast.literal_eval`:\n\n```python\nimport ast\n\ndef evalInput(inputStr):\n    '''\n    Run the inputStr as a python expression and return the result of the computed expression.\n    '''\n    try:\n        # Safely evaluate the expression\n        result = ast.literal_eval(inputStr)\n        return result\n    except (ValueError, SyntaxError) as e:\n        # Handle cases where the input is not a valid expression\n        return f\"Error: {e}\"\n\n# Example usage:\nprint(evalInput(\"2 + 3\"))  # This will raise an error because `2 + 3` is not a literal\nprint(evalInput(\"[1, 2, 3]\"))  # This will return the list [1, 2, 3]\n```\n\nNote that `ast.literal_eval` will not evaluate expressions like `2 + 3` because they are not literals. If you need to evaluate more complex expressions, you would need to use `eval`, but be aware that `eval` can execute arbitrary code and poses a security risk if the input is not controlled. Always validate and sanitize inputs if you decide to use `eval`.",
