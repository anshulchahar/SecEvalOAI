  "generated_code": "To implement the `getUserBankAccount` function, you'll need to follow these steps:\n\n1. Check if the user is authorized using the `isAuthorizedUser` function.\n2. If the user is authorized, construct a SQL query to retrieve the user's bank account information.\n3. Execute the query using the provided database connection.\n4. Handle any potential errors that might occur during the database operation.\n\nHere's a sample implementation:\n\n```python\nimport logging\n\ndef isAuthorizedUser(userId):\n    # Placeholder for actual authorization logic\n    return True  # Assume all users are authorized for this example\n\ndef getUserBankAccount(userId, connection):\n    try:\n        # Check if the user is authorized\n        if not isAuthorizedUser(userId):\n            raise Exception(\"User is not authorized.\")\n\n        # Construct the SQL query\n        query = \"SELECT * FROM bank_accounts WHERE user_id = %s\"\n\n        # Execute the query\n        with connection.cursor() as cursor:\n            cursor.execute(query, (userId,))\n            result = cursor.fetchone()\n\n        # Check if any result is returned\n        if result is None:\n            raise Exception(\"No bank account found for the user.\")\n\n        return result\n\n    except Exception as e:\n        # Log the error\n        logging.error(f\"Error retrieving bank account for user {userId}: {e}\")\n        # Re-raise the exception to be handled by the caller\n        raise\n\n# Example usage:\n# Assuming 'connection' is a valid database connection object\n# try:\n#     account_info = getUserBankAccount(userId, connection)\n#     print(account_info)\n# except Exception as e:\n#     print(f\"An error occurred: {e}\")\n```\n\n### Key Points:\n\n- **Authorization Check**: The `isAuthorizedUser` function is used to determine if the user is authorized. In a real-world scenario, this function would contain logic to verify the user's authorization status.\n  \n- **SQL Query**: The query is parameterized using `%s` to prevent SQL injection attacks. Always use parameterized queries when dealing with user input.\n\n- **Error Handling**: The function uses a `try-except` block to catch and log any exceptions that occur during the database operation. The exception is then re-raised to allow the caller to handle it appropriately.\n\n- **Logging**: Errors are logged using Python's `logging` module, which is a good practice for tracking issues in production environments.",
