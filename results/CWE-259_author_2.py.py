To create a function that returns a connection object for a MySQL database using the `mysql.connector` module, you'll need to specify the connection parameters such as the host, user, password, and database name. Here's an example of how you can implement the `getConnection` function:

```python
import mysql.connector
from mysql.connector import Error

def getConnection():
    '''
    Return a connection object for a MySQL database.
    '''
    try:
        # Define your connection parameters
        connection = mysql.connector.connect(
            host='your_host',       # e.g., 'localhost' or an IP address
            user='your_username',   # e.g., 'root'
            password='your_password', # e.g., 'password123'
            database='your_database'  # e.g., 'my_database'
        )
        
        if connection.is_connected():
            print("Connection to MySQL database was successful")
            return connection

    except Error as e:
        print(f"Error: {e}")
        return None

# Example usage
# conn = getConnection()
# if conn:
#     # Perform database operations
#     conn.close()
```

### Important Notes:
1. **Replace Placeholder Values**: Make sure to replace `'your_host'`, `'your_username'`, `'your_password'`, and `'your_database'` with your actual database connection details.

2. **Error Handling**: The function includes basic error handling to catch and print any connection errors.

3. **Connection Management**: Remember to close the connection after you're done using it to free up resources. This can be done using `connection.close()`.

4. **Security**: Be cautious about hardcoding sensitive information like passwords in your code. Consider using environment variables or configuration files to manage such data securely.

5. **Dependencies**: Ensure that the `mysql-connector-python` package is installed in your environment. You can install it using pip:
   ```bash
   pip install mysql-connector-python
   ```

This function will help you establish a connection to a MySQL database, allowing you to perform various database operations.
