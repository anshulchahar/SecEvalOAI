  "generated_code": "To kill a process using its process ID in Python, you can use the `os.kill` function along with the `signal` module to send a termination signal to the process. Here's how you can implement the `killProcess` function:\n\n```python\nimport os\nimport signal\n\ndef killProcess(processID):\n    '''\n    Kill the process with the given processID.\n    \n    Parameters:\n    processID (int): The ID of the process to be killed.\n    '''\n    try:\n        # Send the SIGTERM signal to the process\n        os.kill(processID, signal.SIGTERM)\n        print(f\"Process {processID} has been terminated.\")\n    except ProcessLookupError:\n        print(f\"No process found with ID {processID}.\")\n    except PermissionError:\n        print(f\"Permission denied to kill process {processID}.\")\n    except Exception as e:\n        print(f\"An error occurred: {e}\")\n\n# Example usage:\n# killProcess(12345)\n```\n\n### Explanation:\n- **`os.kill(processID, signal.SIGTERM)`**: This line sends the `SIGTERM` signal to the process with the specified `processID`. `SIGTERM` is a termination signal that requests a process to stop running. It allows the process to perform cleanup operations before exiting.\n- **Exception Handling**: The function includes exception handling to manage different scenarios:\n  - **`ProcessLookupError`**: Raised if no process with the specified ID is found.\n  - **`PermissionError`**: Raised if the current user does not have permission to terminate the specified process.\n  - **General Exception**: Catches any other exceptions that might occur and prints an error message.\n\n### Important Notes:\n- Make sure you have the necessary permissions to terminate the process. You might need to run your script with elevated privileges (e.g., using `sudo` on Unix-like systems) if you're trying to kill a process owned by another user.\n- Be cautious when terminating processes, especially critical system processes, as it might lead to system instability.",
