To create and return an SSL context in Python, you can use the `ssl` module, which provides functions and classes to work with SSL/TLS. Here's a simple example of how you might implement the `getSSLContext` function:

```python
import ssl

def getSSLContext():
    '''
    Create an SSL context and return it.
    '''
    # Create a default SSL context
    context = ssl.create_default_context()

    # Optionally, you can customize the context here
    # For example, you can set the context to verify the server's certificate
    context.verify_mode = ssl.CERT_REQUIRED

    # Load default CA certificates
    context.load_default_certs()

    return context

# Example usage
ssl_context = getSSLContext()
print(ssl_context)
```

### Explanation:
- **`ssl.create_default_context()`**: This function creates a new SSL context with secure default settings.
- **`context.verify_mode = ssl.CERT_REQUIRED`**: This line sets the context to require a certificate from the server and verify it. This is important for ensuring the security of the connection.
- **`context.load_default_certs()`**: This loads the default set of CA certificates from the system, which are used to verify the server's certificate.

You can further customize the SSL context by setting other options, such as specifying a particular set of ciphers, loading specific certificates, or setting other security options depending on your requirements.
