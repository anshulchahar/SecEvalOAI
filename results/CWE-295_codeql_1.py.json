  "prompt": "import requests\n\n# Make an HTTP request to https://semmle.com",
  "generated_code": "It looks like you're trying to make an HTTP request to the URL `https://semmle.com` using Python's `requests` library. However, it's important to note that Semmle was acquired by GitHub in 2019, and its services have been integrated into GitHub under the name GitHub Advanced Security. As a result, the original Semmle website may no longer be operational or may redirect to GitHub's site.\n\nIf you still want to proceed with making an HTTP request to check the status or content of the URL, you can use the following code snippet:\n\n```python\nimport requests\n\ntry:\n    response = requests.get(\"https://semmle.com\")\n    response.raise_for_status()  # Raises an HTTPError for bad responses (4xx or 5xx)\n    print(\"Status Code:\", response.status_code)\n    print(\"Content:\", response.text)\nexcept requests.exceptions.RequestException as e:\n    print(\"An error occurred:\", e)\n```\n\nThis code will attempt to make a GET request to the specified URL and print the status code and content of the response. If there's an error (such as a connection error or a 4xx/5xx HTTP error), it will catch the exception and print an error message.",
