  "generated_code": "To download a file from an FTP server using Python, you can use the `ftplib` module, which provides a simple interface to interact with FTP servers. Below is a sample implementation of the `downloadFile` function that connects to an FTP server, logs in with the provided credentials, and downloads a specified file:\n\n```python\nimport ftplib\nimport os\n\ndef downloadFile(hostname, username, password, sensitive_file):\n    '''\n    Connect to an FTP server using the hostname provided.\n    Log-in using the username and password provided as parameters.\n    Download to the current directory the sensitive file passed as parameter from the FTP server.\n    '''\n    try:\n        # Connect to the FTP server\n        ftp = ftplib.FTP(hostname)\n        print(f\"Connected to {hostname}\")\n\n        # Login to the server\n        ftp.login(user=username, passwd=password)\n        print(f\"Logged in as {username}\")\n\n        # Open a local file to write the downloaded content\n        with open(sensitive_file, 'wb') as local_file:\n            # Define a callback function to write data to the local file\n            def write_data(data):\n                local_file.write(data)\n\n            # Retrieve the file from the server\n            ftp.retrbinary(f'RETR {sensitive_file}', write_data)\n            print(f\"Downloaded {sensitive_file} to the current directory\")\n\n        # Quit the FTP session\n        ftp.quit()\n        print(\"FTP session closed\")\n\n    except ftplib.all_errors as e:\n        print(f\"FTP error: {e}\")\n\n# Example usage:\n# downloadFile('ftp.example.com', 'username', 'password', 'sensitive_file.txt')\n```\n\n### Key Points:\n- **Connection**: The `ftplib.FTP` object is used to establish a connection to the FTP server.\n- **Login**: The `login` method is used to authenticate with the server using the provided username and password.\n- **File Download**: The `retrbinary` method is used to download the file in binary mode. The `write_data` function is a callback that writes the downloaded data to a local file.\n- **Error Handling**: The `try-except` block is used to catch and print any FTP-related errors.\n- **Resource Management**: The `with` statement ensures that the local file is properly closed after the download is complete.\n\nMake sure to replace `'ftp.example.com'`, `'username'`, `'password'`, and `'sensitive_file.txt'` with",
