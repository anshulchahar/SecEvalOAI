  "generated_code": "To retrieve a list of all assignments in a Canvas course using the `canvasapi` library, you need to first set up a connection to your Canvas instance and then use the appropriate API calls. Below is an example of how you can implement the `get_assignments` function:\n\n```python\nfrom canvasapi import Canvas\n\n# Replace these with your Canvas API URL and API key\nAPI_URL = 'https://your_canvas_instance.instructure.com'\nAPI_KEY = 'your_api_key'\n\ndef get_assignments(course_id):\n    '''\n    Return a list of all the assignments in a Canvas course,\n    with an id equals to the id specified as parameter.\n    '''\n    # Initialize a new Canvas object\n    canvas = Canvas(API_URL, API_KEY)\n    \n    # Get the course by ID\n    course = canvas.get_course(course_id)\n    \n    # Get all assignments for the course\n    assignments = course.get_assignments()\n    \n    # Convert assignments to a list\n    assignment_list = [assignment for assignment in assignments]\n    \n    return assignment_list\n\n# Example usage\n# course_id = 123456\n# assignments = get_assignments(course_id)\n# for assignment in assignments:\n#     print(f\"Assignment ID: {assignment.id}, Name: {assignment.name}\")\n```\n\n### Explanation:\n\n1. **API Setup**: Replace `API_URL` and `API_KEY` with your Canvas instance's URL and your personal API key. You can generate an API key from your Canvas account settings.\n\n2. **Canvas Object**: Create a `Canvas` object using the API URL and key. This object will be used to interact with the Canvas API.\n\n3. **Get Course**: Use the `get_course` method with the provided `course_id` to retrieve the course object.\n\n4. **Get Assignments**: Call the `get_assignments` method on the course object to retrieve all assignments for that course. This returns a paginated list of assignment objects.\n\n5. **Return List**: Convert the paginated list of assignments to a regular list and return it.\n\n6. **Example Usage**: The commented-out section at the bottom shows how you might call this function and print out each assignment's ID and name.\n\nMake sure to handle exceptions and errors in a real-world application, such as invalid course IDs or network issues.",
