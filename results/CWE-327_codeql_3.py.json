  "generated_code": "To determine if a certificate matches a known hash, you need to compute the hash of the certificate and compare it to the known hash. Here's how you can implement the `certificate_matches` function using Python's `hashlib` module:\n\n```python\nimport hashlib\n\ndef certificate_matches(certificate, known_hash):\n    '''\n    Return true if the certificate matches the known_hash.\n    \n    Parameters:\n    - certificate: The certificate data as a string or bytes.\n    - known_hash: The known hash as a hexadecimal string.\n    \n    Returns:\n    - bool: True if the certificate's hash matches the known_hash, False otherwise.\n    '''\n    # Ensure the certificate is in bytes\n    if isinstance(certificate, str):\n        certificate = certificate.encode('utf-8')\n    \n    # Compute the hash of the certificate\n    certificate_hash = hashlib.sha256(certificate).hexdigest()\n    \n    # Compare the computed hash with the known hash\n    return certificate_hash == known_hash\n\n# Example usage:\n# certificate_data = \"-----BEGIN CERTIFICATE-----\\n...\\n-----END CERTIFICATE-----\"\n# known_hash = \"abc123...\"\n# print(certificate_matches(certificate_data, known_hash))\n```\n\n### Explanation:\n- **Encoding**: If the certificate is provided as a string, it is encoded to bytes using UTF-8. This is necessary because the `hashlib` functions operate on bytes.\n- **Hashing**: The SHA-256 hash of the certificate is computed. You can replace `sha256` with another hash function (e.g., `sha1`, `md5`) if needed, but SHA-256 is generally recommended for security reasons.\n- **Comparison**: The computed hash is compared to the known hash. Both are in hexadecimal string format, which allows for a straightforward comparison.\n\nMake sure to replace the hashing algorithm with the one that matches how the `known_hash` was originally computed.",
