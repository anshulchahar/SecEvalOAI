  "generated_code": "To implement the `readFile` function, you can use Python's built-in `os.path` module to check if the file exists and then use a `with` statement to open and read the file. Here's a complete implementation:\n\n```python\nimport os\n\ndef readFile(fileName):\n    '''\n    Check if the file passed as argument exists,\n    then read the file and return its content.\n    '''\n    # Check if the file exists\n    if not os.path.isfile(fileName):\n        return \"File does not exist.\"\n\n    # Read the file and return its content\n    try:\n        with open(fileName, 'r') as file:\n            content = file.read()\n        return content\n    except Exception as e:\n        return f\"An error occurred while reading the file: {e}\"\n\n# Example usage:\n# content = readFile('example.txt')\n# print(content)\n```\n\n### Explanation:\n- **os.path.isfile(fileName)**: This checks if the specified path is an existing regular file.\n- **with open(fileName, 'r') as file**: This opens the file in read mode. The `with` statement ensures that the file is properly closed after its suite finishes, even if an exception is raised.\n- **file.read()**: This reads the entire content of the file.\n- **Exception handling**: The `try-except` block catches any exceptions that might occur while opening or reading the file, such as permission errors or encoding issues, and returns an appropriate error message.",
