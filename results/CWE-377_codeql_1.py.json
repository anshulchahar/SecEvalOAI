  "generated_code": "To write the results to a temporary file using the `mktemp` function from the `tempfile` module, you can follow these steps. This function generates a unique temporary file name, and then you can open this file in write mode to store your results. Here's how you can implement the `write_results` function:\n\n```python\nimport os\nfrom tempfile import mktemp\n\ndef write_results(results):\n    '''\n    Create a temporary file and write the results to it.\n    \n    Parameters:\n    results (str): The results to be written to the temporary file.\n    \n    Returns:\n    str: The path to the temporary file.\n    '''\n    # Create a temporary file path\n    temp_file_path = mktemp()\n\n    # Open the temporary file in write mode and write the results\n    with open(temp_file_path, 'w') as temp_file:\n        temp_file.write(results)\n    \n    # Return the path to the temporary file\n    return temp_file_path\n\n# Example usage\nresults = \"Sample results to be written to a temporary file.\"\ntemp_file_path = write_results(results)\nprint(f\"Results written to temporary file: {temp_file_path}\")\n\n# Optionally, read the content back to verify\nwith open(temp_file_path, 'r') as file:\n    content = file.read()\n    print(\"Content of the temporary file:\")\n    print(content)\n\n# Clean up the temporary file if needed\nos.remove(temp_file_path)\n```\n\n### Explanation:\n- **`mktemp()`**: This function generates a unique temporary file name. Note that this function does not create the file, it only provides a name for it.\n- **Writing to the file**: The file is opened in write mode (`'w'`), and the provided `results` are written to it.\n- **Returning the file path**: The function returns the path to the temporary file, which can be used for further processing or verification.\n- **Cleanup**: After using the temporary file, you may want to delete it to free up resources. This is done using `os.remove(temp_file_path)`.\n\n### Note:\n- The `mktemp()` function is considered unsafe for creating temporary files because it can lead to race conditions. For safer alternatives, consider using `NamedTemporaryFile` or `TemporaryFile` from the `tempfile` module, which handle file creation and deletion more securely.",
