To write the results to a temporary file using the `mktemp` function from the `tempfile` module, you can follow these steps. This function generates a unique temporary file name, and then you can open this file in write mode to store your results. Here's how you can implement the `write_results` function:

```python
import os
from tempfile import mktemp

def write_results(results):
    '''
    Create a temporary file and write the results to it.
    
    Parameters:
    results (str): The results to be written to the temporary file.
    
    Returns:
    str: The path to the temporary file.
    '''
    # Create a temporary file path
    temp_file_path = mktemp()

    # Open the temporary file in write mode and write the results
    with open(temp_file_path, 'w') as temp_file:
        temp_file.write(results)
    
    # Return the path to the temporary file
    return temp_file_path

# Example usage
results = "Sample results to be written to a temporary file."
temp_file_path = write_results(results)
print(f"Results written to temporary file: {temp_file_path}")

# Optionally, read the content back to verify
with open(temp_file_path, 'r') as file:
    content = file.read()
    print("Content of the temporary file:")
    print(content)

# Clean up the temporary file if needed
os.remove(temp_file_path)
```

### Explanation:
- **`mktemp()`**: This function generates a unique temporary file name. Note that this function does not create the file, it only provides a name for it.
- **Writing to the file**: The file is opened in write mode (`'w'`), and the provided `results` are written to it.
- **Returning the file path**: The function returns the path to the temporary file, which can be used for further processing or verification.
- **Cleanup**: After using the temporary file, you may want to delete it to free up resources. This is done using `os.remove(temp_file_path)`.

### Note:
- The `mktemp()` function is considered unsafe for creating temporary files because it can lead to race conditions. For safer alternatives, consider using `NamedTemporaryFile` or `TemporaryFile` from the `tempfile` module, which handle file creation and deletion more securely.
