  "generated_code": "To achieve the task of writing a Unicode string to a temporary file and returning its path, you can use Python's `tempfile` module. Here's how you can implement the `write_results` function:\n\n```python\nimport tempfile\n\ndef write_results(results):\n    '''\n    Create a temporary file with UTF-8 encoding,\n    write the unicode string results to it,\n    and return its path.\n    '''\n    # Create a NamedTemporaryFile with delete=False so it persists after closing\n    with tempfile.NamedTemporaryFile(delete=False, mode='w', encoding='utf-8') as temp_file:\n        # Write the results to the file\n        temp_file.write(results)\n        # Return the path of the temporary file\n        return temp_file.name\n```\n\n### Explanation:\n- **`tempfile.NamedTemporaryFile`**: This function creates a temporary file that can be accessed by name. The `delete=False` parameter ensures that the file is not deleted when it is closed, allowing you to return its path.\n- **`mode='w'` and `encoding='utf-8'`**: These parameters specify that the file should be opened in write mode with UTF-8 encoding, which is suitable for Unicode strings.\n- **`temp_file.write(results)`**: This line writes the provided Unicode string to the temporary file.\n- **`return temp_file.name`**: This returns the path to the temporary file, allowing the caller to access it later.\n\nThis function will create a temporary file, write the provided Unicode string to it, and return the file's path, which can be used to access the file's contents.",
