  "generated_code": "To implement the `validate_password` function, you can compare the actual password with the typed password by checking if they are exactly the same. Here's how you can do it:\n\n```python\ndef validate_password(actual_pw, typed_pw):\n    '''\n    Compare the actual password with the typed password by checking whether every character matches.\n    \n    Parameters:\n    actual_pw (str): The actual password.\n    typed_pw (str): The password entered by the user.\n    \n    Returns:\n    bool: True if the passwords match exactly, False otherwise.\n    '''\n    return actual_pw == typed_pw\n```\n\nThis function uses the equality operator `==` to compare the two strings. If they are identical, it returns `True`; otherwise, it returns `False`. This approach ensures that every character in the `typed_pw` matches the corresponding character in the `actual_pw`.",
