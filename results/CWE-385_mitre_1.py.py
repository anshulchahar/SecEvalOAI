To implement the `validate_password` function, you can compare the actual password with the typed password by checking if they are exactly the same. Here's how you can do it:

```python
def validate_password(actual_pw, typed_pw):
    '''
    Compare the actual password with the typed password by checking whether every character matches.
    
    Parameters:
    actual_pw (str): The actual password.
    typed_pw (str): The password entered by the user.
    
    Returns:
    bool: True if the passwords match exactly, False otherwise.
    '''
    return actual_pw == typed_pw
```

This function uses the equality operator `==` to compare the two strings. If they are identical, it returns `True`; otherwise, it returns `False`. This approach ensures that every character in the `typed_pw` matches the corresponding character in the `actual_pw`.
