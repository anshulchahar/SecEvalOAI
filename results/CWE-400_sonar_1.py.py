To achieve the functionality described in your docstring, you need to extract the username and the file from the HTTP GET request, and then check if the username is part of the filename. Here's how you can implement this in your Flask application:

```python
import re
from flask import request, Flask, jsonify

app = Flask(__name__)

@app.route('/upload', methods=['GET'])
def upload():
    '''
    Get the username and a file attachment from the HTTP GET request.
    Then, search the username in the filename of the attachment.
    '''
    # Get the username from the query parameters
    username = request.args.get('username')
    
    # Get the file from the request
    file = request.files.get('file')
    
    # Check if both username and file are provided
    if not username or not file:
        return jsonify({'error': 'Username and file are required'}), 400
    
    # Get the filename
    filename = file.filename
    
    # Search for the username in the filename
    if re.search(username, filename):
        return jsonify({'message': 'Username found in filename'}), 200
    else:
        return jsonify({'message': 'Username not found in filename'}), 404

if __name__ == '__main__':
    app.run(debug=True)
```

### Explanation:

1. **Route Definition**: The `/upload` route is defined to handle GET requests. Note that typically file uploads are handled via POST requests, but since the requirement specifies GET, this example uses GET.

2. **Extracting Parameters**: The `username` is extracted from the query parameters using `request.args.get('username')`. The file is extracted from the request using `request.files.get('file')`.

3. **Validation**: The code checks if both the `username` and `file` are provided. If not, it returns a 400 error with a message indicating that both are required.

4. **Filename Check**: The `re.search()` function is used to check if the `username` is part of the `filename`. If found, it returns a success message; otherwise, it returns a message indicating that the username was not found in the filename.

5. **Running the App**: The app is set to run in debug mode for easier troubleshooting during development.

### Note:
- Typically, file uploads are done via POST requests, and it's unusual to handle file uploads with GET requests. Consider using POST for file uploads in a production environment.
