  "generated_code": "To implement the `UDPMessaging` function for handling DNS requests over UDP, you'll need to create a UDP socket, listen for incoming packets, parse the packets to extract the DNS query, resolve the query, and send back the appropriate DNS response. Here's a basic implementation outline for these functions:\n\n```python\nimport socket\n\ndef parseUDPpacket(data):\n    # This function should parse the incoming UDP packet to extract the DNS query.\n    # For simplicity, let's assume it returns the domain name being queried.\n    # In a real implementation, you'd need to parse the DNS header and question section.\n    # This is a placeholder for demonstration purposes.\n    return \"example.com\"\n\ndef resolveName(nameToResolve):\n    # This function should resolve the domain name to an IP address.\n    # For simplicity, let's assume it returns a static IP address.\n    # In a real implementation, you'd perform a DNS lookup.\n    # This is a placeholder for demonstration purposes.\n    return \"93.184.216.34\"  # Example IP for example.com\n\ndef sendResponse(sock, client_address, record):\n    # This function sends the DNS response back to the client.\n    # For simplicity, let's assume the response is just the IP address as a string.\n    # In a real implementation, you'd need to construct a proper DNS response packet.\n    response_data = record.encode('utf-8')\n    sock.sendto(response_data, client_address)\n\ndef UDPMessaging(udp_ip, udp_port):\n    # Create a UDP socket\n    sock = socket.socket(socket.AF_INET, socket.SOCK_DGRAM)\n    sock.bind((udp_ip, udp_port))\n    print(f\"Listening for DNS requests on {udp_ip}:{udp_port}\")\n\n    while True:\n        # Receive data from the client\n        data, client_address = sock.recvfrom(512)  # 512 bytes is typical for DNS packets\n        print(f\"Received data from {client_address}\")\n\n        # Parse the UDP packet to extract the DNS query\n        domain_name = parseUDPpacket(data)\n        print(f\"Parsed domain name: {domain_name}\")\n\n        # Resolve the domain name to an IP address\n        ip_address = resolveName(domain_name)\n        print(f\"Resolved IP address: {ip_address}\")\n\n        # Send the response back to the client\n        sendResponse(sock, client_address, ip_address)\n        print(f\"Sent response to {client_address}\")\n\n# Example usage\nif __name__ == \"__main__\":\n    UDPMessaging(\"127",
