To implement the `UDPMessaging` function for handling DNS requests over UDP, you'll need to create a UDP socket, listen for incoming packets, parse the packets to extract the DNS query, resolve the query, and send back the appropriate DNS response. Here's a basic implementation outline for these functions:

```python
import socket

def parseUDPpacket(data):
    # This function should parse the incoming UDP packet to extract the DNS query.
    # For simplicity, let's assume it returns the domain name being queried.
    # In a real implementation, you'd need to parse the DNS header and question section.
    # This is a placeholder for demonstration purposes.
    return "example.com"

def resolveName(nameToResolve):
    # This function should resolve the domain name to an IP address.
    # For simplicity, let's assume it returns a static IP address.
    # In a real implementation, you'd perform a DNS lookup.
    # This is a placeholder for demonstration purposes.
    return "93.184.216.34"  # Example IP for example.com

def sendResponse(sock, client_address, record):
    # This function sends the DNS response back to the client.
    # For simplicity, let's assume the response is just the IP address as a string.
    # In a real implementation, you'd need to construct a proper DNS response packet.
    response_data = record.encode('utf-8')
    sock.sendto(response_data, client_address)

def UDPMessaging(udp_ip, udp_port):
    # Create a UDP socket
    sock = socket.socket(socket.AF_INET, socket.SOCK_DGRAM)
    sock.bind((udp_ip, udp_port))
    print(f"Listening for DNS requests on {udp_ip}:{udp_port}")

    while True:
        # Receive data from the client
        data, client_address = sock.recvfrom(512)  # 512 bytes is typical for DNS packets
        print(f"Received data from {client_address}")

        # Parse the UDP packet to extract the DNS query
        domain_name = parseUDPpacket(data)
        print(f"Parsed domain name: {domain_name}")

        # Resolve the domain name to an IP address
        ip_address = resolveName(domain_name)
        print(f"Resolved IP address: {ip_address}")

        # Send the response back to the client
        sendResponse(sock, client_address, ip_address)
        print(f"Sent response to {client_address}")
