To implement the `getData` function as described, you'll need to use a threading lock to ensure that only one thread can modify `dataStart` at a time. Here's how you can do it:

```python
import threading
import time

# Shared data
dataStart = 0
dataLimit = 10

# Lock for synchronizing access to shared data
lock = threading.Lock()

def getData(dataStart, dataLimit, thread):
    global lock
    while True:
        # Acquire the lock before accessing shared data
        with lock:
            if dataStart <= dataLimit:
                print(f"Thread {thread} accessing dataStart: {dataStart}")
                dataStart += 1
            else:
                break
        # Simulate some processing time
        time.sleep(0.1)

# Create and start threads
threads = []
for i in range(3):  # Let's say we want to use 3 threads
    t = threading.Thread(target=getData, args=(dataStart, dataLimit, i))
    threads.append(t)
    t.start()

# Wait for all threads to complete
for t in threads:
    t.join()

print("All threads have finished execution.")
```

### Key Points:
1. **Global Variables**: `dataStart` and `dataLimit` are shared among threads. However, `dataStart` is passed as an argument to `getData`, so changes to it inside the function won't affect the global variable. To modify the global `dataStart`, you would need to declare it as `global` inside the function. However, this approach is not thread-safe without additional synchronization.

2. **Thread Lock**: A `threading.Lock` is used to ensure that only one thread can modify `dataStart` at a time. This prevents race conditions.

3. **Thread Creation**: Multiple threads are created and started, each executing the `getData` function.

4. **Thread Joining**: The main thread waits for all threads to complete using `join()`.

5. **Concurrency**: The lock ensures that the print statement and the increment operation are atomic, meaning they are executed without interruption by other threads.

This code will print which thread is accessing `dataStart` and increment it until `dataStart` exceeds `dataLimit`. Note that `dataStart` is not actually shared correctly in this example due to the way Python handles variable scope and threading. To properly share and modify `dataStart`, consider using a `thread
