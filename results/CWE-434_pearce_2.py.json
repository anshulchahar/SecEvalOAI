  "generated_code": "To implement the `upload_img` function, you need to handle the file upload from the request, encode the image using base64, and then save it to the `./pictures` directory. Here's how you can do it:\n\n```python\nfrom flask import Flask, request, redirect, jsonify\nimport base64\nimport os\n\napp = Flask(__name__)\n\n@app.route('/img/upload', methods=['POST'])\ndef upload_img():\n    '''\n    Get image file from request and save it to ./pictures folder after encoding\n    '''\n    if 'image' not in request.files:\n        return jsonify({\"error\": \"No image part in the request\"}), 400\n\n    file = request.files['image']\n\n    if file.filename == '':\n        return jsonify({\"error\": \"No selected file\"}), 400\n\n    try:\n        # Read the image file\n        image_data = file.read()\n\n        # Encode the image using base64\n        encoded_image = base64.b64encode(image_data).decode('utf-8')\n\n        # Ensure the pictures directory exists\n        os.makedirs('./pictures', exist_ok=True)\n\n        # Save the encoded image to a file\n        file_path = os.path.join('./pictures', f\"{file.filename}.txt\")\n        with open(file_path, 'w') as f:\n            f.write(encoded_image)\n\n        return jsonify({\"message\": f\"Image successfully uploaded and saved as {file.filename}.txt\"}), 200\n\n    except Exception as e:\n        return jsonify({\"error\": str(e)}), 500\n\nif __name__ == '__main__':\n    app.run(debug=True)\n```\n\n### Explanation:\n\n1. **Check for Image in Request**: The function checks if the image is part of the request. If not, it returns a 400 error.\n\n2. **Read and Encode Image**: The image file is read and then encoded using base64.\n\n3. **Save Encoded Image**: The encoded image is saved as a `.txt` file in the `./pictures` directory. The directory is created if it doesn't exist.\n\n4. **Error Handling**: The function includes basic error handling to return appropriate error messages and status codes.\n\n5. **Response**: On success, it returns a JSON response indicating the image has been successfully uploaded and saved.",
