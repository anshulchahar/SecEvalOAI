  "generated_code": "To implement the `admin_access` function, you'll need to read the username and password from the `request`, validate them, and then set the `HAS_ADMIN_ACCESS` flag to `True` if the credentials are correct. Here's a basic example of how you might implement this:\n\n```python\nHAS_ADMIN_ACCESS = False\n\ndef admin_access(request):\n    '''\n    Read the username and password from the request\n    validate the username and password for admin access.\n    Flag that the user has admin access.\n    '''\n    # Example credentials for admin access\n    ADMIN_USERNAME = \"admin\"\n    ADMIN_PASSWORD = \"password123\"\n\n    # Extract username and password from the request\n    username = request.get('username')\n    password = request.get('password')\n\n    # Validate credentials\n    if username == ADMIN_USERNAME and password == ADMIN_PASSWORD:\n        global HAS_ADMIN_ACCESS\n        HAS_ADMIN_ACCESS = True\n        print(\"Admin access granted.\")\n    else:\n        print(\"Invalid credentials. Access denied.\")\n\n# Example usage\nrequest = {\n    'username': 'admin',\n    'password': 'password123'\n}\n\nadmin_access(request)\nprint(\"HAS_ADMIN_ACCESS:\", HAS_ADMIN_ACCESS)\n```\n\n### Explanation:\n1. **Global Variable**: `HAS_ADMIN_ACCESS` is a global variable that indicates whether the user has admin access.\n2. **Credentials**: For simplicity, the admin credentials are hardcoded as `ADMIN_USERNAME` and `ADMIN_PASSWORD`. In a real-world application, you would retrieve these from a secure database or environment variables.\n3. **Request Handling**: The function expects a `request` dictionary containing `username` and `password`.\n4. **Validation**: The function checks if the provided credentials match the admin credentials.\n5. **Access Flag**: If the credentials are valid, it sets `HAS_ADMIN_ACCESS` to `True`.\n\n### Note:\n- This is a simple example for demonstration purposes. In a production environment, you should use secure methods for handling passwords, such as hashing and using secure storage for credentials.\n- Consider using a framework like Flask or Django, which provides built-in support for handling authentication and authorization.",
