  "generated_code": "To safely handle deserialization of pickle data, it's important to be aware of the security risks associated with using `pickle`. Deserializing data from untrusted sources can lead to arbitrary code execution. If you must use `pickle`, ensure that the data source is trusted. Otherwise, consider using safer alternatives like `json` for data interchange.\n\nBelow is an example of how you might implement the `getPickleData` function, assuming you trust the source of the pickled data:\n\n```python\nimport pickle\n\ndef getPickleData(pickled):\n    '''\n    Return deserialized data from a trusted pickled source.\n    '''\n    try:\n        # Deserialize the pickled data\n        data = pickle.loads(pickled)\n        return data\n    except pickle.UnpicklingError as e:\n        # Handle unpickling errors\n        print(\"Error unpickling data:\", e)\n        return None\n    except Exception as e:\n        # Handle other exceptions\n        print(\"An error occurred:\", e)\n        return None\n```\n\n### Important Considerations:\n- **Trust the Source**: Only unpickle data from sources you trust.\n- **Error Handling**: Implement error handling to manage potential exceptions during the unpickling process.\n- **Alternatives**: If possible, use safer serialization formats like JSON, which do not allow code execution.\n\nIf you are working with Django URLs, note that `django.conf.urls.url()` is deprecated as of Django 3.1. Instead, use `path()` or `re_path()` from `django.urls`:\n\n```python\nfrom django.urls import path, re_path\n\n# Example URL patterns\nurlpatterns = [\n    path('some-path/', some_view_function),\n    # or using regex\n    re_path(r'^some-regex/$', some_view_function),\n]\n```\n\nMake sure to update your URL configurations accordingly if you are using a newer version of Django.",
