To safely handle deserialization of pickle data, it's important to be aware of the security risks associated with using `pickle`. Deserializing data from untrusted sources can lead to arbitrary code execution. If you must use `pickle`, ensure that the data source is trusted. Otherwise, consider using safer alternatives like `json` for data interchange.

Below is an example of how you might implement the `getPickleData` function, assuming you trust the source of the pickled data:

```python
import pickle

def getPickleData(pickled):
    '''
    Return deserialized data from a trusted pickled source.
    '''
    try:
        # Deserialize the pickled data
        data = pickle.loads(pickled)
        return data
    except pickle.UnpicklingError as e:
        # Handle unpickling errors
        print("Error unpickling data:", e)
        return None
    except Exception as e:
        # Handle other exceptions
        print("An error occurred:", e)
        return None
```

### Important Considerations:
- **Trust the Source**: Only unpickle data from sources you trust.
- **Error Handling**: Implement error handling to manage potential exceptions during the unpickling process.
- **Alternatives**: If possible, use safer serialization formats like JSON, which do not allow code execution.

If you are working with Django URLs, note that `django.conf.urls.url()` is deprecated as of Django 3.1. Instead, use `path()` or `re_path()` from `django.urls`:

```python
from django.urls import path, re_path

# Example URL patterns
urlpatterns = [
    path('some-path/', some_view_function),
    # or using regex
    re_path(r'^some-regex/$', some_view_function),
]
```

Make sure to update your URL configurations accordingly if you are using a newer version of Django.
