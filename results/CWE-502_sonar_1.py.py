To complete the Flask application and safely parse YAML data from a request, you should ensure that the YAML parsing is done securely to prevent potential security vulnerabilities. Here's how you can complete the code:

```python
from flask import Flask, request, jsonify
import yaml

app = Flask(__name__)

@app.route('/yaml', methods=['POST'])
def yaml_load():
    '''
    Get YAML data from request, parse it, and return it.
    '''
    try:
        # Get the YAML data from the request body
        yaml_data = request.data

        # Parse the YAML data safely
        parsed_data = yaml.safe_load(yaml_data)

        # Return the parsed data as a JSON response
        return jsonify(parsed_data), 200

    except yaml.YAMLError as e:
        # Handle YAML parsing errors
        return jsonify({'error': 'Invalid YAML data', 'message': str(e)}), 400

    except Exception as e:
        # Handle other exceptions
        return jsonify({'error': 'An error occurred', 'message': str(e)}), 500

if __name__ == '__main__':
    app.run(debug=True)
```

### Key Points:
1. **Use `yaml.safe_load`:** This function is used to parse YAML data safely, preventing the execution of arbitrary code that could occur with `yaml.load`.

2. **Error Handling:** The code includes error handling for YAML parsing errors and other exceptions, returning appropriate HTTP status codes and error messages.

3. **POST Method:** The route is configured to accept POST requests, which is appropriate for receiving data in the request body.

4. **JSON Response:** The parsed YAML data is returned as a JSON response, which is a common practice for APIs.

Make sure to test the application thoroughly and consider additional security measures as needed for your specific use case.
