To complete the `/register` endpoint, you'll need to implement the logic for handling user registration. This involves connecting to the MySQL database, checking if the username already exists, hashing the password, and then inserting the new user into the database. Here's a basic implementation:

```python
@app.route('/register', methods=['POST'])
def register():
    # Get username and password from the request
    username = request.form.get('username')
    password = request.form.get('password')

    if not username or not password:
        return "Username and password are required", 400

    # Hash the password
    hashed_password = hashlib.sha256(password.encode()).hexdigest()

    # Connect to the database
    db = MySQLdb.connect(host="localhost", user="yourusername", passwd="yourpassword", db="yourdatabase")
    cursor = db.cursor()

    try:
        # Check if the username already exists
        cursor.execute("SELECT * FROM users WHERE username = %s", (username,))
        if cursor.fetchone():
            return "Username already exists", 409

        # Insert the new user into the database
        cursor.execute("INSERT INTO users (username, password) VALUES (%s, %s)", (username, hashed_password))
        db.commit()

        return "User registered successfully", 201

    except MySQLdb.Error as e:
        db.rollback()
        return f"An error occurred: {e}", 500

    finally:
        cursor.close()
        db.close()
```

### Important Considerations:
1. **Security**: 
   - Use a stronger hashing algorithm like bcrypt for password hashing instead of SHA-256. Libraries like `bcrypt` provide better security by incorporating salting and multiple rounds of hashing.
   - Always use parameterized queries to prevent SQL injection attacks.

2. **Error Handling**:
   - Ensure proper error handling for database operations to manage exceptions and rollbacks appropriately.

3. **Environment Variables**:
   - Store sensitive information such as database credentials in environment variables or configuration files, not hardcoded in your source code.

4. **Database Schema**:
   - Ensure your database has a `users` table with appropriate columns (`username`, `password`, etc.).

5. **Validation**:
   - Implement additional validation for username and password (e.g., length, complexity) to enhance security and user experience.

6. **HTTPS**:
   - Use HTTPS to encrypt data in transit, especially when handling sensitive information like passwords.
