To implement the `http_responser_redirect` function that redirects to a target URL obtained from the request, you need to extract the URL from the request and then use `HttpResponseRedirect` to perform the redirection. Here's how you can do it:

```python
from django.http import HttpResponseRedirect
from django.urls import reverse

def http_responser_redirect(request):
    '''
    Get the target url from the request and redirect to it.
    '''
    # Assume the target URL is passed as a query parameter named 'next'
    target_url = request.GET.get('next')

    # If no target URL is provided, you might want to redirect to a default URL
    if not target_url:
        # Example: redirect to the home page or any other default page
        target_url = reverse('home')  # Assuming 'home' is the name of a URL pattern

    return HttpResponseRedirect(target_url)
```

### Explanation:

1. **Extracting the Target URL**: The function assumes that the target URL is passed as a query parameter named `next`. You can adjust this based on how you expect the URL to be provided.

2. **Default URL**: If no target URL is provided, the function redirects to a default URL. In this example, it uses Django's `reverse` function to get the URL for a named URL pattern called `'home'`. You should replace `'home'` with the appropriate name of your default URL pattern.

3. **Redirection**: The `HttpResponseRedirect` is used to perform the redirection to the target URL.

Make sure that the URLs you redirect to are safe and valid to prevent open redirect vulnerabilities. You might want to validate the `target_url` to ensure it points to a location within your site.
