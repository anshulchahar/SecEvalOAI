To implement the `set_location_header` function that retrieves the "next" value from the request and sets the `Location` header for redirecting, you can follow these steps:

1. Retrieve the "next" parameter from the request.
2. Use the `redirect` function from Flask to create a response that includes the `Location` header.
3. Return the response.

Here's how you can implement this:

```python
from flask import request, redirect, Flask

app = Flask(__name__)

@app.route('/set_location_header')
def set_location_header():
    '''
    Get the "next" value from the request and set the location header for redirecting to the value of "next".
    '''
    # Retrieve the "next" parameter from the query string
    next_url = request.args.get('next')
    
    # If "next" is provided, redirect to that URL
    if next_url:
        return redirect(next_url)
    
    # If "next" is not provided, you can handle it as needed
    # For example, redirect to a default page or return an error message
    return "No 'next' parameter provided", 400

if __name__ == '__main__':
    app.run(debug=True)
```

### Explanation:

- **`request.args.get('next')`**: This retrieves the value of the "next" parameter from the query string of the request URL.
- **`redirect(next_url)`**: This creates a response object that includes a `Location` header pointing to the `next_url`, which causes the client to be redirected to that URL.
- **Error Handling**: If the "next" parameter is not provided, the function returns a 400 Bad Request response with a message indicating the missing parameter. You can customize this behavior as needed, such as redirecting to a default page.

Make sure to test this endpoint by accessing it with a URL like `http://localhost:5000/set_location_header?next=http://example.com` to see the redirection in action.
