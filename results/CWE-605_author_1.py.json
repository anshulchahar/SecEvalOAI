  "generated_code": "To create a simple echo server using Python's `socket` module, you can follow the example below. This server will listen on a specified port, accept incoming connections, and echo back any messages it receives from clients.\n\n```python\nimport socket\n\ndef echoServer(port):\n    # Create a TCP/IP socket\n    server_socket = socket.socket(socket.AF_INET, socket.SOCK_STREAM)\n\n    # Bind the socket to the port\n    server_address = ('', port)\n    server_socket.bind(server_address)\n\n    # Listen for incoming connections\n    server_socket.listen(1)\n    print(f\"Server is listening on port {port}...\")\n\n    try:\n        while True:\n            # Wait for a connection\n            print(\"Waiting for a connection...\")\n            connection, client_address = server_socket.accept()\n\n            try:\n                print(f\"Connection from {client_address}\")\n\n                # Receive the data in small chunks and echo it back\n                while True:\n                    data = connection.recv(1024)\n                    if data:\n                        print(f\"Received: {data.decode()}\")\n                        print(\"Echoing data back to the client...\")\n                        connection.sendall(data)\n                    else:\n                        print(\"No more data from client, closing connection.\")\n                        break\n\n            finally:\n                # Clean up the connection\n                connection.close()\n\n    except KeyboardInterrupt:\n        print(\"\\nServer is shutting down.\")\n    finally:\n        server_socket.close()\n\n# Example usage\nif __name__ == \"__main__\":\n    echoServer(65432)\n```\n\n### Explanation:\n- **Socket Creation**: A TCP/IP socket is created using `socket.AF_INET` and `socket.SOCK_STREAM`.\n- **Binding**: The socket is bound to an address and port. Here, `''` is used to bind to all available interfaces.\n- **Listening**: The server listens for incoming connections with `listen(1)`, where `1` is the number of unaccepted connections that the system will allow before refusing new connections.\n- **Accepting Connections**: The server waits for a connection using `accept()`, which returns a new socket object representing the connection and the address of the client.\n- **Receiving and Sending Data**: The server receives data in chunks of 1024 bytes and sends it back to the client.\n- **Graceful Shutdown**: The server can be stopped with a keyboard interrupt (Ctrl+C), which will close the server socket.\n\nThis code provides a basic echo server that can be expanded with additional features such as handling multiple clients simultaneously",
