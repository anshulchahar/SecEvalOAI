To handle the XML upload and parsing in your Flask application, you can use the `lxml` library to parse the XML data from the request. Below is a complete implementation of the `/upload` endpoint that reads the XML data from the request, parses it using `lxml`, and returns it as a string:

```python
from flask import Flask, request, jsonify
import lxml.etree as ET

app = Flask(__name__)

@app.post("/upload")
def upload():
    '''
    Get the xml_src from the request, parse it and return it as string.
    '''
    try:
        # Get the XML data from the request
        xml_src = request.data

        # Parse the XML data
        root = ET.fromstring(xml_src)

        # Convert the parsed XML back to a string
        xml_str = ET.tostring(root, pretty_print=True, encoding='unicode')

        # Return the XML string as a response
        return xml_str, 200, {'Content-Type': 'application/xml'}

    except ET.XMLSyntaxError as e:
        # Handle XML parsing errors
        return jsonify({"error": "Invalid XML", "message": str(e)}), 400

    except Exception as e:
        # Handle other exceptions
        return jsonify({"error": "An error occurred", "message": str(e)}), 500

if __name__ == "__main__":
    app.run(debug=True)
```

### Key Points:

1. **Request Data**: The XML data is retrieved from the request using `request.data`.

2. **Parsing XML**: The `lxml.etree.fromstring()` function is used to parse the XML data. If the XML is invalid, an `XMLSyntaxError` will be raised.

3. **Converting to String**: The parsed XML is converted back to a string using `lxml.etree.tostring()`, with `pretty_print=True` for better readability.

4. **Error Handling**: The code includes error handling for XML syntax errors and other exceptions, returning appropriate HTTP status codes and error messages.

5. **Content-Type**: The response is set to have a `Content-Type` of `application/xml` to indicate that the response is XML data.

This implementation assumes that the XML data is sent in the body of the POST request. Make sure to test this endpoint with valid XML data to ensure it works as expected.
