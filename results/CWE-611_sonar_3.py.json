  "generated_code": "To transform an XML document using XSLT with the `lxml` library in Python, you need to follow these steps:\n\n1. Create an XML parser.\n2. Parse the XSLT file to create an XSLT object.\n3. Use the XSLT object to transform an XML document.\n\nHere's how you can implement the `transform_xml` function to achieve this:\n\n```python\nfrom lxml import etree\n\ndef transform_xml():\n    '''\n    Create an XML parser, parse the 'resources/config.xsl' file,\n    and return an XSLT object.\n    '''\n    # Parse the XSL file\n    xslt_file = 'resources/config.xsl'\n    xslt_doc = etree.parse(xslt_file)\n    \n    # Create an XSLT object\n    xslt_transformer = etree.XSLT(xslt_doc)\n    \n    return xslt_transformer\n\n# Example usage\n# Assuming you have an XML file to transform\ndef example_usage():\n    xml_file = 'resources/data.xml'\n    xml_doc = etree.parse(xml_file)\n    \n    # Get the XSLT transformer\n    transformer = transform_xml()\n    \n    # Transform the XML document\n    transformed_doc = transformer(xml_doc)\n    \n    # Print the transformed XML\n    print(str(transformed_doc))\n\n# Uncomment the following line to run the example\n# example_usage()\n```\n\n### Explanation:\n\n- **Parsing the XSLT File**: The `etree.parse()` function is used to parse the XSLT file located at `'resources/config.xsl'`. This creates an XML document object representing the XSLT stylesheet.\n\n- **Creating an XSLT Object**: The `etree.XSLT()` function takes the parsed XSLT document and returns an XSLT transformer object. This object can be used to apply the transformation to XML documents.\n\n- **Transforming an XML Document**: To transform an XML document, parse the XML file into an `etree` object and then call the XSLT transformer with this object. The result is a transformed XML document.\n\nThis code assumes that you have both the XSLT and XML files available in the specified paths. Adjust the file paths as necessary for your environment.",
