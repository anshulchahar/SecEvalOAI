  "generated_code": "To implement the `/download` route in your Flask application, you need to extract the file name from the request, construct the file path, and then use `send_file` to send the file as an attachment to the client. Here's how you can do it:\n\n```python\nfrom flask import request, send_file, Flask, abort\nimport os\n\napp = Flask(__name__)\n\n@app.route('/download')\ndef download():\n    '''\n    Get the file name from the request and parse the name to get the file path\n    Send the file to the client as an attachment.\n    '''\n    # Get the file name from the request arguments\n    file_name = request.args.get('file_name')\n\n    # Check if the file name is provided\n    if not file_name:\n        abort(400, description=\"File name is required\")\n\n    # Construct the file path (assuming files are stored in a directory named 'files')\n    file_path = os.path.join('files', file_name)\n\n    # Check if the file exists\n    if not os.path.exists(file_path):\n        abort(404, description=\"File not found\")\n\n    # Send the file as an attachment\n    return send_file(file_path, as_attachment=True)\n\nif __name__ == '__main__':\n    app.run(debug=True)\n```\n\n### Key Points:\n1. **Request Argument**: The file name is expected to be passed as a query parameter in the URL, e.g., `/download?file_name=example.txt`.\n2. **File Path Construction**: The file path is constructed by joining a directory (e.g., `files`) with the file name. Ensure that the directory exists and contains the files you want to serve.\n3. **Error Handling**: \n   - If the file name is not provided, a `400 Bad Request` error is returned.\n   - If the file does not exist, a `404 Not Found` error is returned.\n4. **Security Considerations**: Be cautious with file paths to prevent directory traversal attacks. You might want to sanitize the file name or use a whitelist of allowed files.\n\nMake sure to replace `'files'` with the actual directory where your files are stored. Also, ensure that the Flask application has the necessary permissions to read the files from this directory.",
