  "generated_code": "To securely store a password, you should hash it using a strong cryptographic hash function. Python's `hashlib` library provides several such functions. Here's how you can implement the `storePassword` function to hash a password and update a database with the username and hashed password:\n\n```python\nimport hashlib\nimport os\n\ndef updateUserLogin(userName, hashedPassword):\n    # This function should update the database with the username and hashed password.\n    # For demonstration purposes, we'll just print the values.\n    print(f\"Updating database for user: {userName} with hashed password: {hashedPassword}\")\n\ndef storePassword(userName, password):\n    '''\n    Hash the password and update the database with username and hashed password by invoking the updateUserLogin() method\n    '''\n    # Generate a random salt\n    salt = os.urandom(16)\n    \n    # Hash the password with the salt using SHA-256\n    hash_obj = hashlib.pbkdf2_hmac('sha256', password.encode('utf-8'), salt, 100000)\n    \n    # Combine the salt and the hash to store them together\n    salt_and_hash = salt + hash_obj\n    \n    # Convert the salt and hash to a hexadecimal string for storage\n    hashed_password = salt_and_hash.hex()\n    \n    # Update the database with the username and hashed password\n    updateUserLogin(userName, hashed_password)\n\n# Example usage\nstorePassword('exampleUser', 'examplePassword')\n```\n\n### Explanation:\n\n1. **Salt Generation**: A random salt is generated using `os.urandom(16)`. The salt is used to ensure that the same password will have different hashes, which helps protect against rainbow table attacks.\n\n2. **Password Hashing**: The password is hashed using the `hashlib.pbkdf2_hmac` function with the SHA-256 algorithm. The `pbkdf2_hmac` function is a key derivation function that applies a hash function (SHA-256 in this case) multiple times (100,000 iterations here) to make brute-force attacks more difficult.\n\n3. **Storing Salt and Hash**: The salt and the hash are combined and converted to a hexadecimal string for storage. This ensures that both the salt and the hash are stored together, which is necessary for verifying the password later.\n\n4. **Database Update**: The `updateUserLogin` function is called to update the database with the username and the hashed password. In a real application, this function would",
