  "generated_code": "To implement the `process_request` function as described, you need to retrieve the \"password\" from the GET request, compare it to an expected value, and redirect to the login page if it matches. Here's how you can do it:\n\n```python\nfrom django.http import HttpResponse\nfrom django.shortcuts import redirect\n\ndef process_request(request):\n    '''\n    Retrieve the \"password\" from the GET request,\n    compare the password to the expected value,\n    if it is the same, redirect to the login page.\n    '''\n    # Define the expected password\n    expected_password = \"your_expected_password\"\n\n    # Retrieve the password from the GET request\n    password = request.GET.get('password')\n\n    # Compare the password to the expected value\n    if password == expected_password:\n        # Redirect to the login page if the password matches\n        return redirect('/login/')\n    else:\n        # Return an error response if the password does not match\n        return HttpResponse(\"Invalid password\", status=401)\n```\n\n### Explanation:\n\n1. **Expected Password**: Define the expected password that you want to compare against. Replace `\"your_expected_password\"` with the actual password you expect.\n\n2. **Retrieve Password**: Use `request.GET.get('password')` to retrieve the password from the GET request. This will return `None` if the parameter is not present.\n\n3. **Comparison**: Compare the retrieved password with the expected password.\n\n4. **Redirection**: If the password matches, use `redirect('/login/')` to redirect the user to the login page. Adjust the URL to match your actual login page URL.\n\n5. **Error Handling**: If the password does not match, return an `HttpResponse` with a status code of 401 (Unauthorized) and an appropriate message.\n\nMake sure to replace `'/login/'` with the correct path to your login page. Also, ensure that this code is part of a Django view and that your Django application is properly configured to handle requests.",
