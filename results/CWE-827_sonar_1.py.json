  "generated_code": "To parse an XML file using `lxml` and return the root element, you can follow these steps. Below is a function that demonstrates how to achieve this:\n\n```python\nfrom lxml import etree\n\ndef getXmlRoot():\n    '''\n    Create an XML parser and parse the resources/c.xml file and return the root element\n    '''\n    # Parse the XML file\n    tree = etree.parse('resources/c.xml')\n    \n    # Get the root element\n    root = tree.getroot()\n    \n    return root\n\n# Example usage\nif __name__ == \"__main__\":\n    root_element = getXmlRoot()\n    print(etree.tostring(root_element, pretty_print=True).decode())\n```\n\n### Explanation:\n\n1. **Import `etree` from `lxml`:** This is necessary to work with XML files using the `lxml` library.\n\n2. **Parse the XML File:**\n   - Use `etree.parse('resources/c.xml')` to parse the XML file located at `resources/c.xml`. This returns an `ElementTree` object.\n\n3. **Get the Root Element:**\n   - Call `tree.getroot()` on the `ElementTree` object to get the root element of the XML document.\n\n4. **Return the Root Element:**\n   - The function returns the root element, which can be used to navigate and manipulate the XML tree.\n\n5. **Example Usage:**\n   - The example usage demonstrates how to call the function and print the XML content in a pretty-printed format.\n\nMake sure that the file path `'resources/c.xml'` is correct and that the file exists at that location. Adjust the path as necessary based on your directory structure.",
