  "generated_code": "To compute the n-th Fibonacci number using loops, you can use an iterative approach. Here's a Python function that does that:\n\n```python\ndef getFibonacci(n):\n    '''\n    Compute the n-th Fibonacci number using loops only.\n    '''\n    if n <= 0:\n        return 0\n    elif n == 1:\n        return 1\n\n    a, b = 0, 1\n    for _ in range(2, n + 1):\n        a, b = b, a + b\n    return b\n\n# Example usage:\n# print(getFibonacci(10))  # Output: 55\n```\n\n### Explanation:\n- The function first checks if `n` is less than or equal to 0, returning 0 in that case, as the Fibonacci sequence is typically defined starting from the 0th or 1st position.\n- If `n` is 1, it returns 1, as the first Fibonacci number is 1.\n- For other values of `n`, it initializes two variables, `a` and `b`, to represent the first two Fibonacci numbers, 0 and 1, respectively.\n- It then uses a loop to iterate from 2 to `n`, updating `a` and `b` to hold the last two Fibonacci numbers at each step.\n- Finally, it returns `b`, which holds the n-th Fibonacci number after the loop completes.",
