  "generated_code": "To implement the `sendData` function as described, you'll need to create a UDP socket that listens for incoming packets, parses each packet, and then sends a response to a specified IP address. Below is a basic implementation of this functionality in Python:\n\n```python\nimport socket\n\ndef parseUDPpacket(data):\n    '''\n    This function is a placeholder for parsing the UDP packet.\n    It should be implemented to extract necessary information from the packet.\n    For this example, let's assume it returns a tuple (response_data, target_ip, target_port).\n    '''\n    # Example parsing logic (to be replaced with actual parsing logic)\n    response_data = data.upper()  # Just an example transformation\n    target_ip = '127.0.0.1'  # Example target IP\n    target_port = 12345  # Example target port\n    return response_data, target_ip, target_port\n\ndef sendResponse(response_data, target_ip, target_port):\n    '''\n    This function sends the response data to the specified IP address and port.\n    '''\n    with socket.socket(socket.AF_INET, socket.SOCK_DGRAM) as sock:\n        sock.sendto(response_data, (target_ip, target_port))\n\ndef sendData():\n    '''\n    This function creates a UDP socket and continuously receives 1024 bytes of UDP packet.\n    After parsing each UDP packet (by invoking parseUDPpacket(data)),\n    it sends the data to the appropriate requested IP address by invoking sendResponse.\n    '''\n    # Create a UDP socket\n    with socket.socket(socket.AF_INET, socket.SOCK_DGRAM) as sock:\n        # Bind the socket to a specific address and port\n        server_address = ('', 10000)  # Listen on all interfaces on port 10000\n        sock.bind(server_address)\n\n        print(\"Listening for incoming UDP packets...\")\n\n        while True:\n            # Receive data from the socket\n            data, address = sock.recvfrom(1024)\n            print(f\"Received {len(data)} bytes from {address}\")\n\n            # Parse the received UDP packet\n            response_data, target_ip, target_port = parseUDPpacket(data)\n\n            # Send the response to the appropriate IP address and port\n            sendResponse(response_data, target_ip, target_port)\n            print(f\"Sent response to {target_ip}:{target_port}\")\n\n# Example usage\nif __name__ == \"__main__\":\n    sendData()\n```\n\n### Key Points:\n- **Socket Creation**: A UDP socket is created using `socket.socket",
