To retrieve user information from a DynamoDB table using a username and password, you should be aware that storing passwords in plaintext is not a recommended practice due to security concerns. Instead, passwords should be hashed and salted before storing them in the database. However, for the sake of this example, I'll show you how to query a DynamoDB table using boto3, assuming that the username and password are stored in the table.

Here's an example of how you might implement the `getUser` function:

```python
import boto3
from botocore.exceptions import ClientError

DYNAMO_CLIENT = boto3.client('dynamodb', config=config)

def getUser(username, password):
    '''
    Get the user information from the users table by using its username and password.
    '''
    try:
        # Query the DynamoDB table
        response = DYNAMO_CLIENT.get_item(
            TableName='users',
            Key={
                'username': {'S': username},
                'password': {'S': password}  # Note: This is not secure for real applications
            }
        )

        # Check if the item exists in the response
        if 'Item' in response:
            return response['Item']
        else:
            return None

    except ClientError as e:
        print(f"An error occurred: {e.response['Error']['Message']}")
        return None

# Example usage
user_info = getUser('example_username', 'example_password')
if user_info:
    print("User found:", user_info)
else:
    print("User not found or incorrect credentials.")
```

### Important Considerations:

1. **Security**: Never store passwords in plaintext. Always hash and salt passwords before storing them. Use libraries like `bcrypt` or `argon2` for password hashing.

2. **Primary Key**: DynamoDB requires a primary key for querying. If your table uses a composite primary key (partition key and sort key), you need to provide both keys in the `Key` parameter.

3. **Error Handling**: Always handle exceptions, especially when dealing with external services like AWS.

4. **IAM Permissions**: Ensure that your AWS credentials have the necessary permissions to access the DynamoDB table.

5. **Environment Configuration**: Make sure your AWS SDK is configured correctly with the necessary region and credentials.

This example assumes that the table's primary key consists of `username` and `password`, which is not a recommended design. Instead, consider using a unique identifier (like `user_id
